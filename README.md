# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
Heart Disease Prediction System! Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction System repository! This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of heart disease, potentially saving patients 
Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset for optimal model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data distributions, correlations, and key insights.
Model Training: Implement multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
Model Evaluation: Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
Prediction Interface: A simple user interface to input patient data and get heart disease risk predictions.
Dataset:
Dataset from Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman: â€œMachine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 20, 16 (2020)
